# What is RAT?

**RAT** is a self-hostable data platform that makes data engineering accessible to everyone. Write SQL (or Python), run pipelines, and query your data — all from a web-based IDE.

<Callout type="info">
RAT is built with a Go platform, Python execution engine, and Next.js portal.
Community Edition is free and open-source.
</Callout>

## Why RAT?

- **Anyone can data** — If you can write SQL, you can build data pipelines
- **Self-hostable** — One `docker compose up` and you're running
- **Batteries included** — Editor, scheduler, query console, lineage, quality tests — all built-in
- **Apache Iceberg** — Your data lives in open table format, not locked in a vendor
- **Git-like isolation** — Each pipeline run gets its own branch — bad data never reaches production

## How It Works

RAT uses a **medallion architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to organize data transformations:

<Mermaid chart={`graph LR
    A["Raw Files"] --> B["Bronze\n(raw ingest)"]
    B --> C["Silver\n(cleaned)"]
    C --> D["Gold\n(business-ready)"]
`} />

You write SQL pipelines that transform data between layers. RAT handles execution, scheduling, versioning, and quality testing.

## Quick Example

Here's a complete pipeline that deduplicates raw orders into a clean Silver table:

```sql filename="pipeline.sql"
-- @merge_strategy: incremental
-- @unique_key: order_id
-- @watermark_column: updated_at

SELECT
    order_id,
    customer_id,
    total_amount,
    status,
    updated_at
FROM {{ ref('bronze.raw_orders') }}
{% if is_incremental() %}
WHERE updated_at > '{{ watermark_value }}'
{% endif %}
```

## Platform at a Glance

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Portal** | Web IDE — editor, query console, DAG visualization |
| **ratd** | Go API server — orchestration, scheduling, auth |
| **runner** | Python pipeline executor — DuckDB + Iceberg writes |
| **ratq** | Python query service — read-only DuckDB queries |
| **Postgres** | Platform state (pipelines, runs, schedules) |
| **MinIO** | S3-compatible object storage for data files |
| **Nessie** | Git-like Iceberg catalog for branch isolation |

## Architecture Overview

RAT runs as 7 containers orchestrated by Docker Compose:

<Mermaid chart={`graph TD
    subgraph compose["docker compose up"]
        ratd["ratd\n(Go) API"]
        ratq["ratq\n(Python) Query"]
        runner["runner\n(Python) Execute"]
        portal["portal\n(Next.js) Web IDE"]
        postgres["postgres"]
        minio["minio"]
        nessie["nessie"]
    end

    ratq -.-> ratd
    ratd --> postgres
    ratd --> minio
    ratd --> nessie
`} />
